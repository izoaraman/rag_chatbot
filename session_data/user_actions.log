PARIS 2024IDENTITY
THE MASCOTS
The Paris 2024 mascots – which have proved par -
ticularly popular with children between the ages of 6 
and 14 – truly reflect the revolutionary spirit of these 
Games.
The Olympic and Paralympic mascots, the “Phryges”, 
were directly inspired by the Phrygian cap, which be -
came a symbol of freedom during the French Revolu -
tion, having been worn by freed slaves in ancient times.
The bright red mascots, complete with big blue eyes, 
tricolour eyelashes and trainers (and, in the Paralympic 
mascot’s case, a prosthetic running blade), embody 
France and promote a dynamic, sporting and inclusive 
ethos.
Designed as a complementary pair, the Phryges will 
be a part of the athlete and fan experience until the 
end of the Olympic and Paralympic Games.
The Phrygian cap, worn by the woman  
in the centre of the picture, is a symbol  
of the French Revolution and inspired  
the mascots of the Paris 2024 Games.

Committee (IOC) gives each host the opportunity to 
propose new sports for inclusion on the Olympic pro -
gramme.
The addition of these sports does not have any impact 
on the quotas of athletes or events in sports already 
on the Olympic programme, and the hosts of the next
